## Launch (from scratch)

Prerequisites

- Node.js (16+) and npm

Steps

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server

```bash
npm run start
```

3. Open the app in your browser

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the port printed by the dev server).

Optional

- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Run tests: `npm test`

That's it — the app should be running locally.
